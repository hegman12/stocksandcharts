# stocksandcharts
This repository is for www.stocksandcharts.in which is a website where one can see company fundamentals like, Revenue from Operations,profit growth,EPS(..and hundreds other parameters) and compare it with price graph. This will provide a better view of valuation of a company. This will only support indian exchange NSE as of now. We can also compare 2 companies based on these graphs. The graphs are developed in such a way that one can directly compare it.
